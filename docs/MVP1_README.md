First step: basic http port 80 Traefik route to the Drupal container

* fix docker-compose startup problem
* add entry points for 80 and 443
* add traefik labels for drupal

To test:

* clone repo
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mvp1.yml pull`
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mvp1.yml up -d`
* on linux, add `idcp.localdomain` to `/etc/hosts` as an alias for localhost
* `lynx http://idcp.localdomain:80/`
* if this works, one should see a Drupal 8.8.1 Installation tasks

Where idcp.localdomain is the .env DOMAIN property
